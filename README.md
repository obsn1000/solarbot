# Your Friendly Solar/Contractor AI

A user-friendly AI to help people make smart decisions before buying solar energy systems or hiring contractors.

## Overview

This project aims to create an accessible AI assistant that can guide users through the process of understanding solar energy options, evaluating costs and benefits, and choosing qualified contractors. It will feature a chat-based interface and potentially voice responses.
